<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a modern, production-ready online store as a Telegram Web App.

**Business Vision:**
- An e-commerce store for entrepreneurs in Poland, integrated within a Telegram Web App.
- It should combine a professional website-like experience with direct Telegram communication, secure payments, and logistics.

**Core Features:**
-   **Store (Customer-facing):**
    -   Product catalog with images, descriptions, variants, and stock availability.
    -   Shopping cart and checkout.
    -   Payment options: Stripe, Przelewy24, BLIK.
    -   Delivery options: InPost Parcel Lockers with a map picker and shipment tracking.
-   **Identity Verification (H2H Orders):**
    -   For certain orders, the customer must record a short face video during checkout to confirm their identity and intent.
    -   A clear UI for the recording process, including consent and data protection information.
-   **Admin Panel (Web-based):**
    -   Sales overview, product management, and order management.
    -   A panel to review and approve/reject verification videos.
    -   Admin authentication and notifications.

**User's Additional Requests:**
- The store should be named Prascy Bandyci with a gold and black theme.
- Focus on an admin panel to manage packages, orders, addresses, and review face recordings.
- Requested the addition of a My Orders page for customers.

**User's preferred language**: Polish. The user has consistently communicated in Polish. The next agent **MUST** respond and interact in **Polish**.

**what currently exists?**
A functional frontend prototype of the Prascy Bandyci e-commerce store, built with React and Tailwind CSS, designed to run as a Telegram Web App. The application features a premium gold-and-black theme.

**Key implemented sections:**
-   **Store UI:** Product catalog, product details, shopping cart, and a complete, multi-step checkout flow.
-   **Admin Panel UI:** A comprehensive dashboard with sections for sales overview, order management, product listings, and a verification review panel.
-   **Mocked Functionality:** All backend operations are mocked on the frontend. This includes user authentication, cart management, payment processing (Stripe, Przelewy24, BLIK, Telegram Pay), order creation, and face video submission.
-   **Feature Pages:** A functional My Orders page for customers to view their order history and a detailed Face Verification page with a mock video recorder.
-   **Telegram Integration:** The UI is optimized for mobile/Telegram Web App, and the Telegram Web App SDK has been included in the project.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the Moje zamówienia (My Orders) page. This involved creating a new React Context () to manage order history, adding a link to the main navigation, and updating the checkout process to save completed orders into this context.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Manual testing confirmed that after a mock payment, the order correctly appears on the My Orders page).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both. Manual testing is needed to verify the full user flow, and the frontend testing agent should be run to catch any regressions, though it has shown some flakiness in the past.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Automated frontend tests are failing during the checkout flow.
    -   **Description:** The  reported that it could not find all payment options on the checkout page. However, manual testing and screenshots confirmed that all payment options (BLIK, Card, Przelewy24, Telegram Pay) are present and visible.
    -   **Priority:** P0 (HIGH)
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent manually verified the UI and confirmed the elements exist. The issue is likely within the test script itself (e.g., a timing issue, not scrolling correctly, or not waiting for elements to render).
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Carefully review the latest test report JSON file in .
        2.  Re-run the  to check if the failure is consistent.
        3.  If it fails again, analyze the test agent's actions and the state of the page at the time of failure. Consider adding explicit waits or scroll actions to the testing logic if possible, or debugging the  for any race conditions.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To establish a reliable automated testing suite, which is crucial for ensuring application stability and catching regressions in future development.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend

**In progress Task List**:
There are no partially completed tasks. The My Orders feature was the last one and is functionally complete from a prototyping perspective.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (P0):**
    -   **Task 1:** Implement real backend logic to replace all mocked functionality. This includes creating APIs for:
        -   User authentication.
        -   Product and stock management.
        -   Order processing.
-   **Future Tasks (P1):**
    -   **Task 2:** Integrate with real payment gateways (Stripe, Przelewy24, BLIK) via the backend.
    -   **Task 3:** Implement secure file upload for the face verification video, storing it and linking it to the corresponding order.
    -   **Task 4:** Build out the full functionality for the Admin Panel, including CRUD operations for products and a functional interface for reviewing verification videos.
    -   **Task 5:** Set up real-time Telegram notifications for order status updates.
    -   **Task 6:** Implement InPost API for parcel locker selection and shipment tracking.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   No issues were mentioned and left unfixed, other than the pending automated testing issue described above. An earlier issue where products were not loading was successfully resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None. This is the first session on this project.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
-   **UI Components:** Shadcn/UI
-   **State Management:** React Context API
-   **Architecture:** Component-based, with a clear separation of pages, components, and contexts.
-   **Integration:** Telegram Web App SDK (for UI/UX adaptation).
-   **Development:** Mock-first development, where all dynamic data and backend interactions are simulated on the frontend.

**key DB schema**
-   No database is currently in use. All data is hardcoded in .

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The project was started from scratch in this session.

**All files of reference**
-   : Main router and provider wrapper.
-   : Core design system with HSL color variables for the gold/black theme.
-   : Tailwind configuration to use the CSS variables.
-   : The heart of the e-commerce flow, integrating cart, user info, delivery, and mock payment processing.
-   : The most recently added feature, displaying customer order history.
-   : State management for the My Orders page.
-   : The single source of truth for all mocked data (products, orders, etc.).
-   : Contains the Telegram Web App SDK script.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The use of multiple React contexts (, , , ) works for the prototype but could become difficult to manage. For a production app, consolidating state management with a library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit would be beneficial.
-   The mock data in  is static. Moving this to a mock API server (like MirageJS or MSW) would better simulate real network conditions and make the transition to a real backend smoother.

**key api endpoints**
-   No real API endpoints exist. The application is a frontend-only prototype. All API calls are simulated within service files like .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Language is Polish:** The user exclusively uses Polish. All communication must be in Polish.
-   **Prototype State:** This is a **frontend-only prototype**. All functionality (payments, user accounts, orders) is mocked. Do not attempt to fix backend issues, as no backend exists yet.
-   **Store Identity:** The project is named Prascy Bandyci, and the visual theme is strictly gold and black.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   Test reports from the  are located in . The exact filenames are dynamic (e.g., ), but they contain the results of the automated UI tests.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.   00:11:48 up 1 day, 11:11,  0 user,  load average: 3.84, 2.93, 1.70
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT (There's no my orders option at all) - **Completed**. The agent implemented the My Orders page and integrated it fully.
2.   (make the face recording) - **Completed**. The agent implemented the UI and mock functionality for the face verification flow.
3.   (make it for a web app for a telegram bot and make payments work) - **Completed**. The agent integrated the Telegram Web App SDK, optimized the UI for mobile, and created a fully mocked but functional payment flow.
4.   (Gold black 2... [slang/informal product names]) - **Completed**. The agent understood this as a request for a gold-and-black theme and the store's name, which was implemented.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** None. The application is functional from a manual user perspective.
-   **Mocked:** Everything. The entire application is a frontend prototype with mocked data and logic.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Telegram Web App SDK**: Integrated for adapting the UI/UX to the Telegram environment. No key required.
-   **Stripe, Przelewy24, BLIK**: These are **mocked** integrations. The UI exists, but no actual API calls are made. Real keys will be required when building the backend.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:** Test reports are located in .
-   **Known regressions:** None from a manual testing perspective. Automated tests are currently failing, but it appears to be an issue with the test script itself rather than a regression in the application code.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   No credentials are required. The application is a frontend prototype with no authentication.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The admin panel UI for **Product Management** () is a simple table view. It lacks the forms and functionality for an admin to actually create, update, or delete products. This would be a required feature for a complete admin panel.
-   The initial requirements mentioned  and  for the admin panel. These concepts were not implemented in the UI prototype.</analysis>
